## Raspberry Pi Backup Camera Project

Below is some information on my personal project. Idea behind the project is to create a backup camera with a distance sensor, code it in Python and install it in a vehicle. Various sources were used during this implementation; I will try to list all of them. The project currently in a development state. Project is an entry-level and does not contain any complicated code, anybody can do it.

### Here is a list of parts: 
- CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 Complete Starter Kit - 32 GB Edition ($69 Amazon)
- Smraza Basic Starter Kit with LCD 1602 (with IIC) for Arduino and Raspberry Pi ($20.59 Amazon)
- Diymore DC 5V Waterproof Ultrasonic Module Distance Measuring Transducer Sensor Module (14.99 Amazon)
- ELP megapixel Super Mini 720p USB Camera Module with 100degree lens ($28.90 Amazon)
- Elegoo 17 Values 1% Resistor Kit Assortment, 0 Ohm-1M Ohm (Pack of 525) ($10.86 Amazon)
- (Need to get) Display

### Getting started:
First of all, after getting my first Raspberry Pi I got all excited to play around with it and create something cool. After watching a lot of videos on the YouTube I decide to make something with a camera. In particular [this project]( http://jeremyblythe.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/raspberry-pi-parking-camera-with.html) got my attention, and I decide use it as a base. 
	First problem I faced was how to stream live video, there are hundreds of ways you can do it, but the one I chose was to use [Pygame]( https://www.pygame.org) Library, due to a simple implementation of a video streaming. 
I used this [tutorial]( http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/CameraIntro.html) on a video streaming.
